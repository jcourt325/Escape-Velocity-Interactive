# Escape-Velocity-Interactive

This is meant to serve as a replacement for [this](https://highered.mheducation.com/olcweb/cgi/pluginpop.cgi?it=swf::800::600::/sites/dl/free/0072482621/78778/Escape_Nav.swf::Escape%20Velocity%20Interactive) flash based simulation, because flash won't be usable after the end of 2020. (Although I added a few more features and presets, this is essentially a direct copy of the flash version. That should fall under Fair Use because this is for educational purposes.)
