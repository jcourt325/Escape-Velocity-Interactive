<p>This simulation is pretty much a direct copy of <a href="https://highered.mheducation.com/olcweb/cgi/pluginpop.cgi?it=swf::800::600::/sites/dl/free/0072482621/78778/Escape_Nav.swf::Escape%20Velocity%20Interactive">this one, which I did not make.</a>.</p>
<p>The main problem with that one is that its flash based, so it <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/end-of-life.html">won't be usable after december 2020</a>.</p>

<p>I added a few more options (more presets, timescale slider, pause, etc.).</p>

<p>Because this is for educational purposes, it should fall under fair use.</p>
